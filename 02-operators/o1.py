# Operators

# One data type we haven't looked at yet is the Boolean, or bool.
# Named for the English mathematician George Boole (1815â€”1864), a Boolean value
# in Python evaluates to either "True" or "False" (the capital is important).

# This will evaluate to True:
statement = (5000 > 500)
print(f"It is {statement} that 5000 is more than 500.")

# The parentheses on line 8 aren't needed; they were just there for clarity.
