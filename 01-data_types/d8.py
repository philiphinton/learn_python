# Numbers

# Define two integers
x = 12
y = 8

# Define two variables that will hold the result of these equations
sum = x+y
difference = x-y

print(f"{x} plus {y} is {sum}.")
print(f"{x} minus {y} is {difference}.")

# There are other operators, such as "*" for multiplication,
# "/" for division, and "%" for modulus.
