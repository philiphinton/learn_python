# Multiplying strings and accessing characters within them

# You can print a string multiple times by... multiplying it!
print("-" * 10)


# Since strings are basically a list, you can also access characters
# or ranges of characters by indexing into them

name = "Phil Hinton"
print(f"Name: {name}")

# First character
print(name[0])
